          <h3>Ma T's Rusks were founded in the town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molteno,_Eastern_Cape">Molteno</a> in 1785 (BC). Ma T was an odd woman, but she sure knew how to bake a rusk. When questioned about her delicious recipe - known to make grown men cry, babies speak Latin, and old ladies dance on top of rocks â€“ Ma T would only look wistfully into middle-distance and say "I learned it from the bears."</h3>

          <h3>Ma T passed away in 1734 (BC), but her legacy lives on through Ma T's rusks. To this day, the residents of Molteno say that if you eat a Ma T Rusk you will gain the gift of the gab, as well as two trial-sized bars of soap and possibly an inexplicable rash.</h3>

          <h3>You can tell a genuine Ma T rusk because it is matt, and should not molte (no!) at the touch. Accept no counterfeits.
